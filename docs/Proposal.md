## Innovative Idea

​	Inspired by the myriad internet arguments transpiring over twitter, YouTube, reddit, and any other site where users can communicate to each other, ChangeMyMind.com serves to provide a place for the internet's best arguers to call home. Our website will allow two people to pick a topic and match against each other, giving them each a platform to share their very valuable opinions. Similar to chess, albeit with much less cognitive ability needed, users can pick an argument "mode": how long each person has to retort their opponent's point, how long the entire argument may last, and a submission mode, where they can keep arguing until one of the two users quit.Once one has submitted to the other's ideas, or more likely both have grown tired of arguing, the discourse is closed, and users can rate their opponent. This rating will be used to match people against those with a similar argumentative ability or lack thereof. The "best" arguments, which is deemed by the users, will be displayed in a gallery, where users can download the chat logs of these arguments

​	Our website's idea was prompted by the hilarity which can be found in long comment chains on forums and popular websites, where both debaters spiral out of coherence. We believe that some sort of consolidation of these chats makes for good fun and perhaps genuine debate as well. This application relates to forums the most, and we just wish to facilitate people's wish to prove others wrong.



##  Important Data

​	Important data for our web application includes the list of topics users can choose to argue from. This list will start off with topics recommended by us, but users will be able to add their own topics to this list. Personality metrics of our users may be used for matchmaking purposes, to ascertain that our Users have the best conversations possible. People may use images in their argument to further their point, as well as stickers (such as a big red WRONG!) for our User's amusement. To save our user's specific information, usernames and passwords will also be necessary for personalized experiences. In short, the five following types of data are important for our webapp: personality metrics, argument topics, images, usernames and passwords.
