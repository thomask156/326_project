The most important thing that I did for this submission was to check in with everyone to make sure that
we had completed everything that we need. Most of the technical work was already completed, so my job
was to make sure that the video (put together by Travis) and the team writeup (mainly written by Thomas and
Mark but with help from the rest of the team including myself) were completed on time. I am keeping everyone
organized and making sure that Thomas knows what everyone is doing so he can include it in the team writeup.

From the technical side, I made the forms for the create arguments page. These work with the data model for
arguments that I helped to design to create the arguments that show up on the argument list, so I had to work 
with Travis to make sure that the arguments I created could be displayed properly.

I also helped Thomas with the ChatMessage form that pulls a message entered by a user and displays it in the chat
window. We also had to work together to make it possible to associate the ChatLobby with the argument created
by the argument form.
