For this project, I created the argument list view. Under views, I retrieved all of the arguments from our data model and sorted them into a list. The list was in chronological order, with the newer arguments on top. I then paired the arguments with the current number of people in the argument.

I also worked on argument_list.html. Here, I looped through the list of arguments given from views.py. Each argument displays the argument name, the topic, the amount of debaters out of the max amount of debaters, and the description of the argument. I also went through the entire project and renamed every instance of "lobby" to "argument" when applicable, to keep our code clean and consistent (this took longer than one would think).

Finally, I created the video presentation for our project. I wrote the script, recorded the video section, and edited it together. I did not create the data model diagram used in the video, but all other assets in the video were edited by me.
