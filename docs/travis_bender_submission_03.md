My contribution to this project submission is getting the video recorded and submitted. I also worked on the argument list website page, and having the argument list work for this submission. 

I created the entire video. I recorded the video and audio aspects of the video. I also put all of the part of the video together, and uploaded it to youtube. I made sure that we had most of our requirements done before the due date, so that I would have sufficient time to create the video.

One thing I have to add in the future is redirection for the argument list page. Right now, when the join argument button is pressed, the user is redirected to their home page. When the website is complete, this will redirect the user to the chat room. This has not been implimented yet, as it require the chat room to be fully functioning. Once this is implimented, my job will be to create the redirection from argument list to the right chat page.
