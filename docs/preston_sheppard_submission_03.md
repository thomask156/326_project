I added the django auth module to our project, created a postsave to automatically create profiles when users are created,
and added login validation to all of the necessary pages.

I added the argument page and widgetized the chat lobby so that it could be included inside of another template, but still have a distinct view which accepts posts and then redirects to the previous page (its pretty sweet).

I spent my remaining time helping other members of the group create the forms and views for their pages. Specifically, I helped mark create his profile page, and thomas create the chat page.
